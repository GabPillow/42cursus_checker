[1] Now is the winter of our discontent
[1] Made glorious summer by this sun of York;
[1] And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
[1] In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
[1] Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;
[1] Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;
[1] Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,
[1] Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.
[1] Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;
[1] And now, instead of mounting barbed steeds
[1] To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,
[1] He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber
[1] To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.
[1] But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,
[1] Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;
[1] I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty
[1] To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;
[1] I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,
[1] Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,
[1] Deformed, unfinish'd, sent before my time
[1] Into this breathing world, scarce half made up,
[1] And that so lamely and unfashionable
[1] That dogs bark at me as I halt by them;
[1] Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,
[1] Have no delight to pass away the time,
[1] Unless to spy my shadow in the sun
[1] And descant on mine own deformity:
[1] And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover,
[1] To entertain these fair well-spoken days,
[1] I am determined to prove a villain
[1] And hate the idle pleasures of these days.
[1] Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,
[1] By drunken prophecies, libels and dreams,
[1] To set my brother Clarence and the king
[1] In deadly hate the one against the other:
[1] And if King Edward be as true and just
[1] As I am subtle, false and treacherous,
[1] This day should Clarence closely be mew'd up,
[1] About a prophecy, which says that 'G'
[1] Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be.
[1] Dive, thoughts, down to my soul: here
[1] Clarence comes.
